\label{subsec:newKPIex}
Having know all the knowledge of new technologies that can be installed on and off the buses and all the new process that are involved to built more interesting KPIs, it is time to make some example, directly related to which data has Arriva now and what it could have in the future. In order to maintain the same scheme of pages in the traditional dashboard in \ref{ch:dashboard}, the KPIs are listed in the same structure:

\begin{table}[H]
